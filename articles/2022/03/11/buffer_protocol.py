    https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html
    Certain objects available in Python wrap access to an underlying memory array or buffer.
    Such objects include the built-in bytes and bytearray, and some extension types like array.array.
    Third-party libraries may define their own types for special purposes,
    such as image processing or numeric analysis.
